# Settings for controlling the extraction process
setting:
  # Discretization of gray levels. For CT, a fixed bin width is recommended
  # over normalization to maintain consistency of HU units across patients.
  binWidth: 25

  # Ensure all voxels are resampled to be isotropic (same size in all dimensions)
  # This is critical for rotationally-invariant features.
  resampledPixelSpacing: [1, 1, 1]  # Resample to 1x1x1 mm voxels

  # Interpolator for resampling. 'sitkBSpline' is a good default for images.
  interpolator: 'sitkBSpline'

  # # Correct the mask to ensure it only contains the specified label and is connected.
  # correctMask: true

  # first order specific settings:
  voxelArrayShift: 1000  # Minimum value in HU is -1000, shift +1000 to prevent negative values from being squared.

# Image types to be used for feature extraction.
# 'Original' uses the raw image data.
# 'LoG' (Laplacian of Gaussian) highlights edges and textures at different scales.
# 'Wavelet' decomposes the image into different frequency bands.
imageType:
  Original: {}
  LoG:
    # Sigma values control the "coarseness" of the textures being highlighted.
    # Using a range captures textures of different sizes.

# Feature classes to be enabled. All features within these classes will be extracted.

  # CRITICAL: Enable 3D shape features. These are often the most predictive.
