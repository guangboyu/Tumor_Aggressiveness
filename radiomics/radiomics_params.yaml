# Settings for controlling the extraction process
setting:
  # Discretization of gray levels. For CT, a fixed bin width is recommended
  # over normalization to maintain consistency of HU units across patients.
  binWidth: 25

  # Ensure all voxels are resampled to be isotropic (same size in all dimensions)
  # This is critical for rotationally-invariant features.
  resampledPixelSpacing: [1, 1, 1]  # Resample to 1x1x1 mm voxels

  # Interpolator for resampling. 'sitkBSpline' is a good default for images.
  interpolator: 'sitkBSpline'

  # Set verbosity level of pyradiomics logging
  verbosity: 'INFO'

  # Correct the mask to ensure it only contains the specified label and is connected.
  correctMask: true

# Image types to be used for feature extraction.
# 'Original' uses the raw image data.
# 'LoG' (Laplacian of Gaussian) highlights edges and textures at different scales.
# 'Wavelet' decomposes the image into different frequency bands.
imageType:
  Original: {}
  LoG:
    # Sigma values control the "coarseness" of the textures being highlighted.
    # Using a range captures textures of different sizes.
    sigma: [1.0, 2.0, 3.0]
  Wavelet: {}

# Feature classes to be enabled. All features within these classes will be extracted.
featureClass:
  # CRITICAL: Enable 3D shape features. These are often the most predictive.
  shape:

  # First-order statistics (histogram-based)
  firstorder:

  # Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) - texture features
  glcm:

  # Gray Level Run Length Matrix (GLRLM) - texture features
  glrlm:

  # Gray Level Size Zone Matrix (GLSZM) - texture features
  glszm:

  # Gray Level Dependence Matrix (GLDM) - texture features
  gldm:

  # Neighbouring Gray Tone Difference Matrix (NGTDM) - texture features
